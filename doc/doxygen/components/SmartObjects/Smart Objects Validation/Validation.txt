/*! \page components_smartobjects_validation_use Using Schema for validation

The main purpose of Schema is to validate existing Smart Object. This process includes type and value validation. The results of validation can be used by the client to know is given Smart Object valid or not. Validation for specific Smart Object can be triggered using NsAppLink::NsSmartObjects::CSmartSchema::validate method. Internally Schema triggers respective validate method of every Schema Item in order to perform validation.

Another feature of Schema is capability to be applied to the Smart Object. Applying means that Schema tries to modify object to "normalize" data. Currently this "normalization" effects on string representation of enums. Applying of the Schema can be triggered using NsAppLink::NsSmartObjects::CSmartSchema::applySchema method. Internally Schema triggers respective apply method of every Schema Item and at the moment only enum Schema Items tries to covert string representation to enum values.

To "unapply" modifications done by apply feature Schema has NsAppLink::NsSmartObjects::CSmartSchema::unapplySchema method. It can be used to make string representations of enums.
